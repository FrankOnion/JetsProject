# Jets Application

## Description
The Jets Application is a Java-based program that simulates a fleet of jets with different capabilities. It allows users to interact with the fleet through a menu-driven interface, performing actions such as listing jets, flying them, viewing jet statistics, loading cargo, engaging in dogfights, and more. The application demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, class inheritance, and interface implementation.

## Tech Used
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Interfaces
- Collections (List)

## Lessons Learned
- Implementing class inheritance in Java to create a base class (Jet) and specialized subclasses (CargoJet, FighterJet, PassengerJet).
- Utilizing interfaces to define specialized behaviors (CargoCarrier, CombatReady) and applying them selectively to classes.
- Managing collections (List) for storing and manipulating jet objects.
- Designing a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) menu for user interaction.
- Handling user input and menu navigation in a console application.
- Testing and refining code to ensure functionality and user-friendliness.
- Programming while sick is really hard

## Future Improvements
- Implementing persistent data storage to save and load jet fleet data between program sessions.
- Adding more advanced jet behaviors and interactions, such as fuel management and repairs.
- Extending the types of jets and interfaces to include more diverse capabilities.
